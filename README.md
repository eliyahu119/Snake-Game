## Description

Welcome to the classic Snake Game implemented in [programming language/framework]. Control the snake using the arrow keys and guide it to eat food, grow longer, and avoid collisions with the walls and your snake's tail.

## Features

- Intuitive arrow key controls: Use the arrow keys (up, down, left, right) to control the snake's direction.
- Increasing difficulty: As the snake grows longer, the game becomes progressively challenging.
- Score tracking: Your score increases with each food item eaten.
- Game Over conditions: The game ends if the snake hits the walls or collides with its own tail.


## Installation

To run the Snake Game, you need to have Python installed on your system.

## Usage

1. Use the arrow keys to navigate the snake:
   - **Up Arrow:** Move the snake upwards.
   - **Down Arrow:** Move the snake downwards.
   - **Left Arrow:** Move the snake to the left.
   - **Right Arrow:** Move the snake to the right.
2. Eat the food to grow longer and increase your score.
3. Avoid hitting the walls and the snake's tail, as this will end the game.
